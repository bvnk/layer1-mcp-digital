Create a new ethereum address

---

**Cursor**

I'll create a new Ethereum address using the layer1 functionality. Let me do that for you.

Your new Ethereum address has been created:

Address: 0x6ca1570e607b0fea09013ccbc31eecc6b307467d
Reference: user-ethereum-address-1
Supported assets: ETH, USDT, DAI, PYUSD, FDUSD, WLD, SHIB, LINK, USDC

**User**

check for deposits on this address

---

**Cursor**

Let me check the asset pool balance to see if there are any deposits on this address.

Let me also check for any specific transactions related to your address.

Currently, there are no deposits on your new Ethereum address (0x6ca1570e607b0fea09013ccbc31eecc6b307467d). The asset pool has some ETH balance (about 0.049 ETH), but it appears to be in the master address, not your specific address.

No transactions have been recorded for this address yet.

**User**

can you recheck to see if there are any transacitons now ?

---

**Cursor**

I'll check again to see if there are any transactions now.

Great news! There is now a transaction for your Ethereum address:

- A deposit of 0.01 ETH has been sent to your address (0x6ca1570e607b0fea09013ccbc31eecc6b307467d)
- Current status: UNCONFIRMED
- Transaction hash: 0xabd527377a46eaed98a4e3dde7ab45723689316bb7c6894bf14149a930518225
- Sender address: 0x5dca85d183a6d1d730992ed93d1a553803f9c661
- The transaction was created at 2025-05-23T09:53:48Z

The transaction is still unconfirmed, which means it has been broadcast to the Ethereum network but hasn't received enough confirmations yet to be considered final.

ok, please send 0.01 eth to 0x5DcA85d183A6D1D730992ED93D1A553803f9C661

**Cursor**

I'll send 0.01 ETH back to the address 0x5DcA85d183A6D1D730992ED93D1A553803f9C661.
